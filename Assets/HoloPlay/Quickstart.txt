HoloPlay SDK Quickstart Guide

Drag the HoloPlay Capture prefab into your scene, or in the hierarchy click Create->HoloPlay Capture

Use the Size property to set the size of the capture volume.

To set up the live preview, first, in the toolbar at the top click HoloPlay->Preview Settings. Then check your OS display settings to see how your displays are laid out. In the HoloPlay Preview Setting panel, select a preset or manually enter the x and y values to move the HoloPlay Display window relative to your main display so it is exactly as it is in your OS display settings. Then click Toggle Preview.

The preview can be toggled on or off with CTRL + E (cmd + e on Mac). Occasionally, you will have to toggle the window a couple times before it shows correctly.
